### Safe Care Digital Auditing MVP
```
Android Native - Kotlin

```

## About 

SafeCare is a nursing documentation software that allows nurses to record all patient documentation digitally as opposed to the traditional paper format. In doing so, SafeCare removes the nursing ‘audit’ task, saving 104,000e per nursing home per year.

This is a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and we are still in the early stages of development.

## Business Objectives 
* Speed up documentation time for nurses by 60%
* Remove the need for nurses to audit nursing homes. In turn saving 2,000e per nursing home per week
* Increase quality and regulation compliance
