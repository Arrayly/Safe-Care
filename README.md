### Safe Care Digital Auditing App


## About

SafeCare is a nursing documentation software that allows nurses to record all patient documentation digitally as opposed to the traditional paper format. In doing so, SafeCare removes the nursing â€˜auditâ€™ task, saving 104,000e per nursing home per year.


## Business Objectives ðŸŽ¯
* Speed up documentation time for nurses by 60%
* Remove the need for nurses to audit nursing homes. In turn saving 2,000e per nursing home per week
* Increase quality and regulation compliance
